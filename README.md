## Challenge Overview

This skills application focuses on **Development Environment Setup and Project Management** - essential skills for Java software engineers to create, configure, and manage development environments and project workflows effectively.

You'll learn how to set up comprehensive development environments, manage project dependencies, configure development tools, implement project structure best practices, and establish efficient development workflows that support collaborative software development.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this challenge, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure comprehensive Java development environments
- Initialize and structure Java projects with proper conventions
- Manage project dependencies and build configurations
- Configure development tools and IDE settings for optimal productivity
- Implement project documentation and development workflow standards
- Establish testing and code quality processes for Java projects

## Prerequisites

Before starting this challenge, ensure you have:
- Completed JSE Unit 1 Async 3-6 (CLI, Command Line, Git fundamentals, and Git collaboration)
- Basic understanding of Java development concepts
- Familiarity with command line operations and Git workflows
- Access to a development environment with Java and Git installed

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Java Development Environment Setup
**Objective:** Set up a comprehensive Java development environment with proper tooling and configuration.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a new directory `~/dev-environment-setup` as your workspace
2. Set up Java development environment:
   - Verify Java installation and version
   - Configure JAVA_HOME environment variable
   - Set up PATH for Java tools
3. Initialize a new Java project structure:
   - Create standard Maven directory structure
   - Set up proper package hierarchy
   - Create basic project configuration files
4. Document your environment setup:
   - Create `environment-setup-log.txt` with all setup steps
   - Include system information and tool versions
   - Document any configuration changes made

### Task 2: Project Configuration and Dependency Management
**Objective:** Configure project settings and manage dependencies using Maven build system.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a Maven project configuration:
   - Set up `pom.xml` with proper project information
   - Configure Java version and compiler settings
   - Add common dependencies (JUnit, logging framework)
2. Set up project structure:
   - Create proper source and test directories
   - Set up resource directories
   - Configure build output directories
3. Create sample Java files:
   - Main application class with proper package structure
   - Utility classes demonstrating good project organization
   - Unit test files with proper naming conventions
4. Document dependency management:
   - Create `dependency-management-guide.txt`
   - Explain Maven lifecycle and common commands
   - Document project structure rationale

### Task 3: Development Tools and IDE Configuration
**Objective:** Configure development tools and IDE settings for optimal productivity.

**Requirements:**
1. Set up development tool configurations:
   - Create `.editorconfig` for consistent code formatting
   - Set up code style and formatting rules
   - Configure Git hooks for code quality
2. Create development scripts:
   - `build.sh` - Script to build the project
   - `test.sh` - Script to run all tests
   - `clean.sh` - Script to clean build artifacts
3. Set up quality assurance tools:
   - Configure checkstyle for code style enforcement
   - Set up PMD for static code analysis
   - Configure test coverage reporting
4. Document tool configurations:
   - Create `development-tools-guide.txt`
   - Explain each tool's purpose and configuration
   - Include IDE setup recommendations

### Task 4: Project Documentation and Standards
**Objective:** Establish comprehensive project documentation and development standards.

**Requirements:**
1. Create project documentation:
   - Write comprehensive `README.md` for the project
   - Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development guidelines
   - Set up `CHANGELOG.md` for version tracking
2. Establish coding standards:
   - Create `CODING_STANDARDS.md` with Java best practices
   - Document naming conventions and code organization
   - Set up code review guidelines
3. Create development workflow documentation:
   - Document Git workflow for the project
   - Create issue and pull request templates
   - Set up project milestone and release processes
4. Document project standards:
   - Create `project-standards-summary.txt`
   - Explain the importance of each documentation piece
   - Include maintenance and update procedures

### Task 5: Testing and Quality Assurance Workflow
**Objective:** Implement comprehensive testing and quality assurance processes.

**Requirements:**
1. Set up testing framework:
   - Configure JUnit for unit testing
   - Set up integration testing structure
   - Create test data and mock configurations
2. Implement automated quality checks:
   - Set up continuous integration simulation
   - Create `quality-check.sh` script for automated testing
   - Configure code coverage reporting
3. Create comprehensive test suite:
   - Write unit tests for sample classes
   - Create integration tests
   - Set up performance and load testing examples
4. Document testing processes:
   - Create `testing-workflow-guide.txt`
   - Explain different types of testing implemented
   - Document quality gates and acceptance criteria
5. Set up project monitoring:
   - Create `project-health-check.sh` script
   - Set up metrics collection and reporting
   - Document project health indicators

## Success Criteria

Your environment setup and project management implementation will be considered successful when:

âœ… **Environment Setup:** Java development environment is properly configured with all necessary tools and settings  
âœ… **Project Structure:** Maven project follows standard conventions with proper dependency management  
âœ… **Tool Configuration:** Development tools are configured for optimal productivity and code quality  
âœ… **Documentation:** Comprehensive project documentation covers all aspects of development workflow  
âœ… **Quality Assurance:** Testing and quality processes are implemented with automated checks  
âœ… **Workflow Integration:** All components work together to support efficient development processes  

## Verification

Run the provided test script to verify your implementation:

```bash
./test_completion.sh
```

The script will verify:
- Environment setup and configuration
